### hi,

- ðŸ”­ iâ€™m currently working at Otimize and UFAL (Universidade Federal de Alagoas)
- ðŸŒ± iâ€™m currently learning about Bluetooth connection with Flutter
- ðŸ«€ i especially like: **pair programming**, **gaining know-how** & **reading documentations**
- i'm also a leadership member of [@itmufal](https://github.com/itmufal): [ImersÃ£o TecnÃ³logica para Mulheres](https://itmufal.github.io) & [@katie.ufal](https://github.com/GrupoKatie): [Grupo Katie](https://ic.ufal.br/extensao/katie/)

and my heart beats for collaborative problem-solving and continuous learning.
