### hi,

- ðŸ”­ iâ€™m currently working at Otimize and UFAL (Universidade Federal de Alagoas)
- ðŸŒ± iâ€™m currently learning about Bluetooth connection with Flutter
- ðŸ«€ i especially like: **pair programming**, **gaining know-how** & **reading documentations**
- i'm also a leadership member of @itmufal: itmufal.github.io 

and my heart beats for collaborative problem-solving and continuous learning.
