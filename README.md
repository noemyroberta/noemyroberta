### Hi, I'm Noemy!

**A Software Engineer by day ☼ and a Student by night ☾**

Software Engineer, CEO & co-founder at [Viventio] - my first-born son (https://viventio.com.br/) <br>
Graduating in Computer Science

- ⚙️ I use daily: `.dart`, `.py`, `.java`, `.json`, `.fig`, `.tsx`
- 💬 `Ping` me about API, mobile development, Flutter, UX, performance & algorithms, web apps, BLE and more...
- 🫀 I especially like **pair programming**, **gaining know-how** & **reading documentations**

and my heart beats for collaborative problem-solving and continuous learning.
