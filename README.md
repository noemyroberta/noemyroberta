### hi,

- 🔭 i’m currently working at Otimize and UFAL (Universidade Federal de Alagoas)
- 🌱 i’m currently learning about Bluetooth connection with Flutter
- 🫀 i especially like: **pair programming**, **gaining know-how** & **reading documentations**
- i'm also a leadership member of [@itmufal](https://github.com/itmufal): [Imersão Tecnólogica para Mulheres](https://itmufal.github.io)

and my heart beats for collaborative problem-solving and continuous learning.
